# I keep track of my expenses on my iPhone Notes app, I found they became somewhat disorganized and ambigous to sort through at the end of the month
, so I thought, "Huh, I could probably make a program for that". In this folder is the small program I wrote, the blank budjet XL sheet
I regularly used before writing the program, and a short sample of what my expense data looks like before its sorted.

All advice welcomed!
